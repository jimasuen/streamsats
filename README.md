# Streamsats

# Problem
How can streamers incentivize their audience to continue watching their streams? How can streamers appreciate the viewers' time spent on their livestreams? How can streamers do all this without doing "extra work" during the live stream? 

# Solution
Why not incentivize your viewers with bitcoin and make the process so simple that the streamer doesn't need to do anything extra? With Streamsats you can appreciate your viewers with bitcoin. All your viewers need to do is scan a QR code and get rewarded random amounts in bitcoin.
